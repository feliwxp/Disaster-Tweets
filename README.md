Data source: [Kaggle competition link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview)

## Problem Statement

The objective is to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. 

## Dataset Description

Each sample in the train and test set has the following information:

- The text of a tweet
- A keyword from that tweet (although this may be blank!)
- The location the tweet was sent from (may also be blank)

You are predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. If so, predict a `1`. If not, predict a `0`.
